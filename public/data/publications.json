        "description": "Our study explores how caregivers, patients and community members discuss Alzheimer’s and dementia on Reddit. By analyzing these real-life conversations, we aimed to understand the emotional and practical challenges that caregivers face and why online spaces have become sources of shared learning, empathy, and support. We also examined some patient-related demographics through the caregivers’ narratives to learn how patients’ symptoms differ across these demographics."

        "description": "As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a perplexity as low as 2.90."
